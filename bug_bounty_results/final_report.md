# Security Assessment Report - certinia.com
Generated: March 1, 2025

## Executive Summary

A basic security assessment was performed on certinia.com and its subdomains, focusing on HTTP security headers and basic infrastructure analysis.

## Discovered Hosts

1. **certinia.com (Main Domain)**
   - HTTPS: Yes (200 OK)
   - Server: Cloudflare
   - Powered by: WP Engine
   - Strong security header implementation
   - Comprehensive CSP policy in place

2. **www.certinia.com**
   - HTTPS: Yes (302 Redirect)
   - Server: Cloudflare1
   
   - Limited security headers
   - Missing several important security headers

3. **blog.certinia.com**
   - HTTPS: Yes (301 Redirect)
   - Server: Cloudflare
   - Basic security headers
   - Missing several important security headers

4. **help.certinia.com**
   - HTTPS: Yes (403 Forbidden)
   - Server: AmazonS3
   - Strong security header implementation
   - Well-configured CSP policy

## Security Headers Analysis

### Main Domain (certinia.com)
✅ Strong Security Implementation:
- HSTS with includeSubDomains
- Comprehensive Content Security Policy
- X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection enabled

❌ Missing Headers:
- Referrer-Policy
- Permissions-Policy

### Help Portal (help.certinia.com)
✅ Strong Security Implementation:
- HSTS with includeSubDomains
- Strict CSP with limited sources
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection with block mode
- Strict Referrer Policy

## Infrastructure Details

1. **CDN Usage**
   - Cloudflare protection on main domain and most subdomains
   - Amazon S3 for help documentation

2. **Technology Stack**
   - WP Engine (WordPress hosting)
   - Various third-party services integrated (via CSP)

## Security Observations

### Positive Findings
1. HTTPS enforced across all discovered endpoints
2. Strong CDN protection (Cloudflare)
3. Comprehensive CSP on main domain
4. No exposed cookies without security flags
5. No information disclosure in headers

### Areas for Improvement
1. Inconsistent security headers across subdomains
2. Missing Permissions-Policy headers
3. Missing Referrer-Policy on some endpoints
4. Varying levels of CSP implementation

## Recommendations

1. **Header Standardization**
   - Implement consistent security headers across all subdomains
   - Add missing Permissions-Policy headers
   - Implement Referrer-Policy on all endpoints

2. **CSP Enhancement**
   - Extend comprehensive CSP to www subdomain
   - Review and potentially restrict CSP sources

3. **Additional Security Measures**
   - Consider implementing CAA DNS records
   - Review and standardize HSTS implementation
   - Implement security headers on redirect endpoints

## Limitations

This assessment was limited to:
- Basic HTTP security headers analysis
- Subdomain enumeration
- Surface-level infrastructure analysis

A more comprehensive security assessment would require proper authorization and additional tools.
